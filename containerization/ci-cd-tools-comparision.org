   - container oriented. Every build step is also executed in a container, so
     you effectively get a guaranteed clean environment every single build.
   - Plugins can be written in ANY language. You know a language? Great, you can
     write a plugin. Even if that language is bash, no worries. You simply build
     a Docker image that can execute in, out, and check and it works. The power
     of this can't be understated.
   - Highly scalable. Workers just don't care about anything as long as they can
     talk to the ATC. I can press a button and scale it up or down, or upgrade
     the version without a problem. The only thing that has to be persistent
     really is the database.
   - The config files are very human readable. Jenkins pipelines are whatever,
     but Concourse definitions basically serve as a whole backup. They specify
     what resources you need and will pull them if they don't have it. Just very
     versatile.
